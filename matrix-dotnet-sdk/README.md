# Matrix .NET SDK

This open-source library allows you to build .NET apps compatible with Matrix Protocol
(http://www.matrix.org).
It has support for a limited subset of the APIs presently. 

This SDK was built for interaction with the Beacon Node (https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-node). It supports login through the crypto auth provider (https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-node/blob/master/docker/crypto_auth_provider.py).
